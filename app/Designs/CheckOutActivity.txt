Check out climbs and points of the team

Functions:
    - OnCreate - Overwritten
        - Creates the screen
        - Shows th login screen if user is not authenticated
        - Keeps data of users and team synced
        - Calls onClickForPlaces(String) to set the correct UI and list the necessary routes by calling populateClimbedRoutesList(String, String)

    - onClickForPlaces(String) -> sets the correct UI, calls populateClimbedRoutesList(String, String)

    - populateClimbedRoutesList(String, String) -> populates the routes climbed
        - Gets the routes climbed for the climber from the database for the place given
        - lists them, sets the correct UI

    - removeClimb(String, String, String, double) -> removes the given climb from the database from the climber

    - showAlertDialogButtonClicked(View, String, String, String, double, LinearLayout)
        - Shows a warning to the user if they want to remove the climb
        - calls removeClimb if positive

    - addCustomRemove()
        - Creates a fancy UI for removing stuff. I guess, it was long time ago.
        - calls showAlertDialogButtonClicked()

Would be great:
    - When using the name selector, it would be great to set the screen default
    - Would be great to show the points for the team on the main screen too
