Handling registration, login, and password reset

Functions:
- OnCreate - Overwritten
    auth -> Firebase Authentication instance. If exists, MainActivity is started with the authenticated user and OnCreate is finished.

    else:
    - Login screen is set up
    - OnClickListeners are set up
        - Sign Up button - calls SignUpActivity
        - Reset button - calls ResetPasswordActivity
        - Login button - calls auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword with the email and password provided
            - saves provided email and password
                - shows error when these are empty
            - If sign in fails, display a message to the user.
            - If sign in succeeds the auth state listener will be notified and logic to handle the signed in user can be handled in the listener.
            - If user is not verified, it warns the user to verify the email

    All functions are handled in Firebase.
